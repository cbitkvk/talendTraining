Thank you every one Let's give a big hand to our outstanding young exhibitors today 
Thank you for coming out in strength on a Sunday Reid Hoffman your LinkedIn is a great product And you are an inspiration
to many here and in India Thank you Mohan Venkie Ambassador It is a great pleasure to be here 
For me this is a special event because the idea of startups is close to my heart You are likely to wonder why 
because governments and national capitals are supposed to stop or slow things down not start them up 
I know this was once the view of Washington from Silicon Valley and this is exactly how tech specialists in Bengaluru thought about New Delhi
And I know that many of you think that the only problems that have not been solved are the ones for which you have not written the apps yet 
When I shifted to Delhi last year I thought of my government as a Startup So I also saw some of the bumps you face on the road 
I understand your challenges but also the wonderful feeling of creating something new 
The course of human history and progress has been shaped by imagination inspiration invention and innovation 
I often say if there's a strong wind blowing some might want to shut the window Others will want to put up a windmill or launch t
heir sails on the seas The difference between perception of something as a challenge or an opportunity is the difference 
between inertia and initiative status quo and progress The idea of Start Ups is as ancient as this world 
Each economic age has been defined by disruption of the previous one by the evolution of ideas and products that displace the old ones 
Start Ups have always been the engine of progress The mega corporations of today were Startsup of yesterday 
What is different now is that the digital age has created a fertile new environment for Startups 
This is a world in which you don't grow by extracting resources but by spreading an idea More than the creator 
it is the consumer who discovers applications 
Today the Startups defy the natural rates of growth An idea can become a global name within a year 
Customers can multiply at the rate of millions employees at the rate of thousands and valuation at the rate of billions 
The convergence of technology integration across diverse fields distributed architecture and people willing to back an idea 
have opened a new world for enterprise This ecosystem was born in the Silicon Valley No community is shaping our world 
as much as the one on this Californian Coast It isn't just big names but small firms that are fashioning every day new ways to 
enrich human life with the joy of artists and creators That underlines America's success and inspires the world 
So I see Startups technology and innovation as exciting and effective instruments for India's transformation 
and for creating jobs for our youth We are a nation of 800 million youth below the age of 35 years They are eager for change 
have the energy and drive to pursue it and the confidence to achieve it When each of the five hundred odd towns produces 
ten Startups and each of our six hundred thousand villages produce six small businesses on a regular basis 
we will create an enormous economic momentum and generate a huge number of jobs in our country
